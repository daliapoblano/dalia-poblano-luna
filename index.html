        <h2> About </h2>
        <p> Hi there! My name is Dalia and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at New Jersey City University.
            My passion for coding began in high school, after I participated in an enrichment program for high school students to become exposed to STEM careers.
            Lately, my interest has shifted to web development and UX/UI design. 
            I am excited to create functional websites in the near future and develop stronger skills and foundations through Code the Dream!
            Aside from programming, I enjoy painting, baking, going on long walks, and exploring new places. </p>
